🚀 Tab Dev (Prototype)
Tab Dev is a prototype browser extension that lets you generate and inject AI-created JavaScript into the current tab — no manual coding required.

✨ How It Works
1️⃣ Enter your Google Gemini 2.0 API key
2️⃣ Write a prompt → AI generates JavaScript
3️⃣ Review the code (optional)
4️⃣ Click Run → Script is injected into the tab

⚠️ Notes
Prototype version (for testing only)

Runs fully on the client side

Be cautious: injected code can change page behavior
